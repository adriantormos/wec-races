  "description": "At the start of the race, [b]the #7 Toyota and #50 Ferrari managed to keep their top 2 positions[/b]. Having a poor start, [b]the #8 Toyota hit and spun the #51 Ferrari at the first chicane[/b], for which it was given a 10 second penalty.\nThe entire pack was close, all in around 15 seconds, until they started lapping the GTE AM field. 15 minutes into the race, [b]the #8 Toyota hit a GTE AM car, ending its race and/ngetting a stop and go penalty[/b]. [b]The Safety Car was brought out and 5 cars[/b] (#2 Cadillac, #6 Porsche, #38 Jota, #51 Ferrari and #99 Proton) [b]opted to box[/b]. [b]They lost position, but could save a stop at the end[/b]. They were out of sync but, in theory, leading the race by almost an entire pit-stop. All the while, the #4 Vanwall drifted off, having very poor pace.",
