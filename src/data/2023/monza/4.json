  "description": "With just an hour to go, [b]the #50 Ferrari had fresher tyres and was closing the gap with the leading #8 Toyota[/b], which was in need of new tyres at the last pit stop. [b]Ferrari, though, decided not to gamble[/b] and also changed to new tyres, losing the chance to snatch the lead in the pits. Ultimately, [b]the #50 Ferrari didn’t have the pace to contest the lead on track[/b]. [b]Completed by a #93 Peugeot in no man’s land, the podium was now set in stone[/b].\nWith minutes to go, the #8 Toyota was able to get to 4th, ahead of the #51 Ferrari and the #5 Porsche. However, [b]penalties for the Ferrari and Toyota brought them down again[/b]. Behind them, the #6 Porsche and the #708 Glickenhaus finished 7th and 8th. Two laps down were the #38 Jota and #2 Cadillac.",
