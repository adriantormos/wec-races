  "description": "After the Safety Car ended, the race mainly stabilized. Over the next two hours, the [b]leading #7 Toyota was able to pull a 45 second gap to the #50 Ferrari and #93 Peugeot[/b], in second and third. Penalties for the #38 Jota and the #2 Cadillac put them 2 laps behind the leader. And still 9th, [b]the #8 Toyota was timing its strategy to barely hang in the lead lap[/b] as much time as possible, in case of another Safety Car.\nA bit over 4 hours in, a Safety Car would indeed arrive, as [b]the #99 Proton lost power and came to a stop on track[/b]. However, the timing was just not right and [b]the #8 Toyota needed to splash and dash[/b]. Because of the different pit stop cycles, most cars had just stopped and were caught a lap down, meaning [b]only the top 3 remained in the lead lap now[/b].",
