  "description": "On the first round of pit stops, [b]a driver error made the #93 Peugeot lose the lead of its peloton[/b]. [b]Several gearbox issues for the #94 Peugeot[/b] also meant it needed to pit for repairs, losing multiple laps. Having served all its penalties, [b]the #8 Toyota was now a lap down[/b]. [b]Minutes later, the #2 Cadillac also had trouble in a stop[/b], needing to reset and losing ground with the lead group.\n [b]Around 2 hours in, the #6 Porsche and #7 Toyota led their respective groups[/b] (the former just having snatched the lead from the #38 Jota) right when [b]an LMP2 car had a big crash in Lesmo II, bringing out the Safety Car again[/b]. [b]This was horrible timing for the out-of-sync cars[/b], who had to pit for a splash and dash and [b]lost an entire lap with the rest of the cars[/b].",
