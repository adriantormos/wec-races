  "description": "6 hours had passed when [b]chaos ensued again at the track, as it resumed raining heavily[/b]. [b]Several cars went off the track[/b], the #50 Ferrari and the #2 Cadillac having the biggest scares, and everyone pitted for wet tyres.\nJust before, the #709 Glickenhaus had lost 4 laps to a wrongly fitted tyre.\nIn the rain, [b]the #51 Ferrari managed to keep the car on the track and increased its lead to around a minute after the scrambles in the pits[/b]. [b]The #94 Peugeot comfortably took second place[/b], having no incidents and taking advantage of its 4-wheel drive.\nJust minutes later, [b]the #75 Porsche had to retire due to fuel pressure issues[/b].\nThe race remained stable until hour 8, with [b]6 cars on the lead lap[/b].",
