  "description": "As the race finally settled down, [b]the #8 Toyota and the #51 Ferrari battled within seconds for the lead[/b], while [b]the #2 Cadillac slowly drifted off[/b] as the hours passed.\nDuring the 16th hour, [b]the #8 Toyota hit a squirrel on track that caused front damage and a gradual loss of pace[/b]. Victory was escaping Toyotaâ€™s hands.\nAround the 16 hour mark, almost 2 laps down in fourth place, [b]the #3 Cadillac was being chased closely by the #6 Porsche[/b]. The Porsche was losing ground and pushing to the limit to keep the pace. After a few near misses, [b]the #6 Porsche finally went off in Arnage after trying to divebomb an LMP2 car[/b], hitting the barriers and losing 11 more laps.",
