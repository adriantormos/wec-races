  "description": "Around the 8 hour mark, [b]the leading #51 Ferrari span at the first Mulsanne chicane[/b] after reacting to a collision between a GTE car and the #708 Glickenhaus, [b]narrowly avoiding being lapped[/b].\nBarely 2 minutes later, [b]the #7 Toyota retired after being hit by multiple cars[/b] when slowing down too early at a Slow Zone, due to another slowing car. This caused [b]another hour-long Safety Car[/b], resetting the race again.\n[b]A very close 5-way battle for the lead[/b] took place during the next hours. However, [b]mechanical problems for the #50 Ferrari and an accident at the first chicane for the #94 Peugeot[/b] meant that [b]only 3 cars remained in the lead lap[/b] halfway through the race.\nThe #5 Porsche, #38 Jota and #4 Vanwall lost more ground due to various problems too.",
