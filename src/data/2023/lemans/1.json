  "description": "The Centenary race started with a drying track. In a chaotic first lap, [b]the #311 Cadillac spun on the first Mulsanne chicane[/b] and [b]the #8 Toyota stole the lead from the Ferraris[/b]. The Cadillac was forced to pit and would lose more than an hour fixing the severe damage it had picked.\nAfter a Safety Car period due to barrier reparations, [b]a 13-hypercar peloton battled for the lead[/b] while [b]the #4 Vanwall struggled to keep up[/b]. One lap behind was the #708 Glickenhaus, who started from the pits because of gearbox issues before the race.",
