  "description": "The race started in [b]mixed conditions[/b], as the track was quickly drying.\n[b]The two Ferraris, the two Peugeots, the #2 Cadillac and the #38 Jota started on wet tyres[/b] and thrived at the start, pulling a small gap to the rest. After less than half an hour, though, [b]the track had dried enough that their gap had disappeared and their wet tyres were destroyed[/b], forcing a tyre change.\nOne hour into the race, [b]these 6 cars were a lap behind the leaders, out of sync strategy-wise[/b], with new slick tyres. The two Ferraris had especially struggled with warming their new tyres, and were in last place.",
