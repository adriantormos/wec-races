  "description": "After another round of pit-stops, [b]the #50 Ferrari spun on cold tyres[/b] right as it exited the pit lane [b]and had to retire[/b]. Another Safety Car later, the two Toyotas ran very closely. [b]The #7 Toyota made its last stop first, and crucially overtook the sister Toyota for the lead[/b] while it was still on cold tyres. Even with a time penalty, [b]it was able to manage the gap and win the race[/b].\nBehind, the #51 Ferrari and #2 Cadillac needed an extra pit stop compared to the #5 Porsche. On the last stint, [b]the Ferrari managed to close a 45s gap and passed the Porsche for 3rd place[/b] on the last lap. Meanwhile the Cadillac drifted off in 5th place. 2 laps off, the #93 Peugeot had issues but managed to hold off the #708 Glickenhaus at the end.",
