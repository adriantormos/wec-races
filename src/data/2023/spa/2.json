  "description": "After the first round of pit-stops, [b]the #7 Toyota led the #3 Cadillac and the #6 Porsche[/b]. Fourth ran the sister Toyota, who had started at the back of the field.\n100 minutes into the race, though, [b]the #3 had a big accident in Eau Rouge[/b]. And less than half an hour later, [b]the #6 stopped on track due to an electrical issue and had to retire[/b].\nTwo Safety Car periods later, [b]the two Ferraris were gaining positions[/b] despite their tyre issues, thanks to their higher pace. Now they were chasing the #2 Cadillac, first of the cars with an extra stop. The #94 Peugeot and the #4 Vanwall lost more ground because of a sudden loss of power in the pits and a spin on cold tyres, respectively.\n",
