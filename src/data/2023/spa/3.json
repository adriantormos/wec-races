  "description": "At the 3:30h mark, [b]the #4 Vanwall crashed after being punted by a GTE AM car[/b] right before Blanchimont.\nThe following Safety Carbunched all cars together by lap. [b]The #8 Toyota was able to get back more than a minute[/b] to the leading sister car. On the other hand, [b]the timing was unlucky for the #38 Jota, who was forced to make an extra splash and dash, and the #93 Peugeot, who had just pitted. Both lost another lap[/b].\nAt the 4h mark, on green flag conditions, [b]the #8 Toyota had lost some ground again[/b] and [b]the 4 cars one lap behind were on the verge of unlapping themselves[/b].",
