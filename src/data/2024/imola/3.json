  "description": "At the second round of stops, around two hours into the race, most cars put on new tyres. Despite having a slow stop and losing time, [b]the #51 Ferrari could keep the lead[/b]. [b]Its sister #50 car[/b], not changing tyres, [b]jumped to third again, as the #6 Porsche changed all tyres[/b]. Shortly out of the pits, [b]it also overtook the #7 Toyota for second[/b]. A slow stop for the #20 BMW lost them positions too, down to 9th place. Out of the points, the #2 Cadillac got a puncture and became out-of-sync strategy-wise. And right out of the pits, on cold tyres, an #11 Isotta that already struggled for pace span and lost additional time.\n\nAround two hours and a quarter in, [b]the #12 Jota hit the wall at Tosa[/b]. [b]Both Jota cars already were uncharacteristically uncompetitive all race[/b], and although the car could keep going, it fell off the top 10. Not much more action happened until the midpoint of the race, only notably the #7 Toyota slowly catching up the #50 Ferrari with older tyres ahead.\n\nHalfway through the race, the field came for a third stop. The #51 Ferrari and #7 Toyota on third changed one side of tyres, while the #50 Ferrari remained on very old ones. Almost right out of the pits, [b]the #51 Ferrari got blocked by an LMGT3 and had to aggressively defend from its sister #50 car, who didn't manage to pass[/b]. On the following laps, [b]the #50 Ferrari struggled to have any pace but was successfully defending[/b] the Ferrari 1-2 from Toyota. Behind, the #20 BMW was back in 7th place, being the only newcomer car with good pace.",
