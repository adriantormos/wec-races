  "description": "Three hours and a half into the race, drama struck as [b]it started to drizzle in Variante Alta[/b]. The track dampened quickly, and [b]it caught the #11 Isotta and the #12 Jota, who both spun consecutively[/b], bringing out the Full Course Yellow. Very quickly it started raining from Tosa and Piratella. In the restart, [b]the #7 Toyota reacted quicker and overtook the #50 Ferrari for second[/b].\n\nIn a matter of minutes, [b]chaos ensued as it started to rain lightly on all the circuit and the #94 Peugeot and the #12 were out on the gravel[/b], prompting a Virtual Safety Car period. [b]Most of the field stopped for new slick tyres under the VSC[/b], but crucially, [b]the #51 Ferrari lost the lead to the #7 Toyota as it stopped just before it started[/b]. And just one lap later, as the VSC became a full Safety Car, [b]drizzle became rain and the track was declared wet[/b]. But a full Safety Car meant the pit entry was closed and [b]no one could stop for wet tyres until the race restarted[/b].\n\nWith just above two hours to go, the race restarted and once again cars were immediately running through the gravel. The track was damp enough that [b]all the field stopped for wet tyres except for all the Ferraris and the #5 Porsche, who gambled on the rain not lasting enough[/b]. However, the track conditions only got worse and [b]the gamble did not pay off[/b], and the Ferraris were losing more than 10 seconds per lap. They stopped just minutes later, but it was too late: [b]the former leaders came out of the pits a full minute behind[/b], 6th to 8th, and [b]the #7 Toyota was now on the lead[/b].",
