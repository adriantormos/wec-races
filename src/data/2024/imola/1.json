  "description": "The race started in dry conditions. The Ferraris, starting in the top 3, kept the podium places, although [b]the #51 Ferrari passed the #83 for second place[/b]. At the back of the field, though, there was a [b]big crash at Tamburello that involved 5 hypercars[/b]: the #11 Isotta tapped an Alpine and caused a multiple reaction that damaged the Isotta itself, both Alpines, the #94 Peugeot and the #15 BMW. [b]The Safety Car was called immediately[/b]. While [b]the Isotta and the #35 Alpine could rejoin[/b] without much damage, [b]the sister Alpine, the Peugeot and the BMW needed extensive repairs[/b] and lost several laps.\n\nAfter the Safety Car period ended, the field ran closely for a few laps. The top 10 remained mostly unchanged after the start, as apart from the Ferraris switching positions, [b]only the #7 Toyota managed to pass the #5 Porsche[/b]. The Ferraris were followed by the Porsches, Toyotas and #20 BMW. Soon, though, two things would be clear: [b]it was very hard to overtake[/b], and [b]Ferrari, Porsche and Toyota[/b] had a bit more pace than the rest. As laps went by, the top 6 opened a gap while the midfield couldn't keep the pace. The #8 Toyota was stuck in 8th place behind the #20 BMW and lost more than 10 seconds to the other cars ahead. Notably, running in 11th, [b]the #63 Lamborghini was comfortably keeping with the midfield[/b] this time.\n\nDuring this first hour, [b]the #93 Peugeot had momentary gearbox issues[/b] that cost it some places, although it could continue the race without issue and, most importantly, without being lapped.",
