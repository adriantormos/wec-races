  "description": "As the sun set in Qatar, gravel was starting to accumulate at the outside of Turn 9, and it was becoming a delicate spot. [b]The #38 Jota almost collided with an LMGT3 car[/b] there, [b]and the #2 Cadillac did hit one[/b] only a few laps later, without real consequence.\n\nSix hours into the race, the debutant #63 Lamborghini reported its first issue of the race. After small repairs, it was now definitely in no manâ€™s land in 17th, one lap behind its nearest competitor and only ahead of the repaired #94 Peugeot in last.\n\nNow in the dark of the night, no one could follow the pace of the #6 Porsche. In the span of two hours, with slight tyre advantage, [b]the #6 Porsche increased its lead again from 9 to more than a minute[/b] over the #93 Peugeot. Meanwhile, [b]its sister #5 car had vibration issues again[/b] and had to make another extra stop for repairs, dropping down to 7th place. While recovering places, it fought a very defensive #38 Jota for various laps, making contact a couple of times, until overtaking it on the inside at Turn 6. And after a shorter pit-stop than the cars around it, it bounced back up to 4th place.\n\nA bit over seven hours in, Turn 9 struck again as [b]the #36 Alpine slid through the gravel[/b] after slightly tapping an LMGT3, managing to avoid the barriers and coming in unscathed.",
