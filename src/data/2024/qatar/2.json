  "description": "At about half an hour into the race, on lap 16, [b]the #93 Peugeot finally overtook the #50 Ferrari for the lead[/b] at Turn 1 after several laps of pressure. Clearly with more pace, the now-leader got away, [b]putting up to 11 seconds between them and second place[/b] before the first round of pit-stops. Behind, [b]the #50 Ferrari defended second place[/b] from the intense pressure of the Porsches, and the midfield still ran very close, but without many overtakes.\n\nOn lap 19, [b]Peugeot decided to pit their #94 car[/b], which was stuck in the midfield and incapable of overtaking, in hopes that [b]running off-sync in clear air would recover them some positions[/b] after the pit-stops.\n\nRight before the 1-hour mark, the first round of pit-stops began. On this first shuffle, [b]the #50 Ferrari boxed some laps earlier[/b] than the rest, [b]and got overcut by the Porsches[/b], falling down to 6th place just in front of its sister car. [b]The #6 Porsche became second, best of the Porsches,[/b] and [b]the #94 Peugeot managed to jump up to 10th place[/b] with its alternate strategy. Slow stops for both BMWs put them in 16th and 17th, and Cadillac saw their #2 car fall to last place after having to replace its front.\n\nOne hour had passed now, and [b]the #93 Peugeot lead the Porsches and the Ferraris[/b]. However, it was slowly starting to lose ground with the #6 Porsche.",
