  "description": "Four and a half hours in, the race had a second small Full-Course Yellow because of debris on the track. At the time, the #50 Ferrari and #8 Toyota had been fighting on track for more than 30 minutes for the last points-scoring position, surprisingly instead of for the lead. \n\nImmediately after, the start of the fifth round of pit-stops ended the battle, with the Ferrari coming up ahead. During its pit-stop, [b]Toyota had a problem with their wheelgun that made the #8 car fall down to 15th[/b]. And just a few laps later, almost at the same time, [b]the #11 Isotta suffered a front-left suspension failure and the #94 Peugeot had a battery issue[/b]. While the Peugeot could repair the problem, albeit losing around 20 laps and any chance left it had at scoring points, [b]the Isotta Fraschini team preferred to retire the car[/b] and study the issue in detail.\n\nFinally in the second half of the race, during the sixth hour [b]the #93 Peugeot cut down the distance with the leading #6 Porsche down to only 9 seconds[/b]. [b]The #5 Porsche was back on the podium[/b], having passed the #12 Jota in the pits. The #83 AF Corse and #38 Jota almost had their races ended when an LMGT3 car unsafely rejoined the track after a run through the gravel at Turns 9 and 10. [b]The #50 Ferrari continued its recovery drive[/b] with very good pace and was up to 8th, now ahead of the also recovering #2 Cadillac. And in the midfield, due to the problems of the #8 Toyota and #94 Peugeot, a new battle emerged for the last point-scoring position: [b]the #36 Alpine inherited 10th place[/b], and momentarily was [b]the only newcomer car in the points[/b], but it was being quickly caught up by the #99 Proton, with fresher tyres. They ran nose to tail for 10 laps, until the Proton was finally able to go by at Turn 1.",
